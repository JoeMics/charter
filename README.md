## üìö Introduction

<b>[Charter](https://charter-map.herokuapp.com/)</b> is a full-stack application that allows users to create maps and pin different points of interests on the area to share them around.

With millions of people staying indoors due to the pandemic, it's become harder for everyone to go around and find new interesting places. This is where Charter comes in and helps people recommend their favorite spots around the city, and provide their reviews on feedback on the spots. This makes it easier for people to simply search for spots near them and share them around.
